Looking for a cheap way to monitor your kids when they're in a different room 
or to make sure your dog's not sleeping on the couch? Perch may have the answer for you.
The company, developed as part of Samsung's New York-based accelerator program for startups, 
takes gadgets you already own and turns them into simple home-monitoring devices. 
The free software, released in beta Wednesday, is initially compatible with PCs 
and standard USB webcams, as well as with smartphones, tablets and digital cameras 
running Android 4.1 or higher. In the coming months, the software will spread to iPhones, 
iPads, smart TVs and traditional security cameras.
"Our goal is to be the easiest way to get started doing home monitoring," 
Perch CEO Andrew Cohen told CNET. "You're able to set up in a matter of minutes and take a device 
and keep an eye on your kids while they're playing in the next room."
Perch is the latest company to emerge from Samsung's New York accelerator. 
In 2013, the South Korean electronics giant established two centers, one in Manhattan and the other 
in Silicon Valley, to help entrepreneurs get their products started. In return,
 Samsung owns a stake in the companies and gets easier access to their technologies. 
So far, no big hits have emerged from Samsung's accelerator.
